 Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.
 But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. 
 So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.
 This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the  user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

- Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.
- Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes)



//ANSWER:
  
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char username[100];
    cin >> username;

    int counter = 0;
 
/* any string of characters ends with the NULL\0 , so if the element number i in this string equal to NULL, 
   then break the loop and return the counter which refers to the length of the string: */
    for (int i = 0; username[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        counter++;
    }

    if (counter % 2 == 0) //even
        cout << "CHAT WITH HER!\n";
    else //odd
        cout << "IGNORE HIM!\n";
}

// Another way using the built in function strlen(): //

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char username[100];
    cin >> username;

    int counter = strlen(username);
    if (counter % 2 == 0) //even
        cout << "CHAT WITH HER!\n";
    else //odd
        cout << "IGNORE HIM!\n";
}
