
//PROBLEM: define an array with a specific size you choose, and make the user input the elements of this array as he wants.
  After that, rearrange the numbers in ascending order once, and in descending order another one.

//ANSWER:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int arr[5]; 
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		cin >> arr[i];   //test: 100 56 102 30 10
	}

	int n = 1;
	int empty = 0;
	for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
	{
		for (int i = n; i < 5; i++) 
		{
			if (arr[j] > arr[i])
			{
				empty = arr[j]; 
				arr[j] = arr[i]; 
				arr[i] = empty;      // 10 30 56 100 102
				                    //   0  1  2  3   4
			}		
		}
		n++;  //6  is the last stored value in n.
	}

	cout << "------------------------------\n";

	for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++)
	{
		cout << arr[x] << "  ";
	}
}


 - Note1: This is the code of ascending order, if want to rearrange in descending order, just change the sign < in the condition:
   if (arr[j] < arr[i]) {}
                      

 - Note2: I can improve the process of the code by not declare the variable n , and just make i = j+1 in the second for loop,
   instead of creating a variable n and increase it every time as follow: 

for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
  {
	for (int i = j+1; i < 5; i++) 
         { }
  }
